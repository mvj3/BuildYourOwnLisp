<p>If you're looking to learn C, or you've ever wondered how to build your own programming language, this is the book for you.</p>

<p>In just a few lines of code, I'll teach you how to effectively use C, and what it takes to start building your own language.</p>

<p>Along the way we'll learn about the weird and wonderful nature of Lisps, and what really makes a programming language. By building a <em>real world</em> C program we'll learn implicit things that conventional books cannot teach. How to develop a project, how to make life easy for your users, and how to write beautiful code.</p>
